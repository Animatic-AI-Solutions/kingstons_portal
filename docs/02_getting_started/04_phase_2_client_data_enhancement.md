### Networth Snapshot Structure

#### Data Organization by Item Types
The networth statement organizes data hierarchically by item types, with individual items and subtotals. The managed/unmanaged status is specified at the individual item level to allow mixed management status within the same item type category. Data keys correspond to the product owner's "known as" names for display purposes:

```json
{
  "id": "unique_identifier",
  "client_id": "client_reference", 
  "snapshot_date": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS",
  "created_by": "user_id",
