### Networth Snapshot Structure

#### Data Organization by Item Types
The networth statement organizes data hierarchically by item types, with individual items and subtotals. The managed/unmanaged status is specified at the individual item level to allow mixed management status within the same item type category:

```json
{
  "id": "unique_identifier",
  "client_id": "client_reference", 
  "snapshot_date": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS",
  "created_by": "user_id",
  "data": {
    "item_types": [
      {
        "type": "GIAs",
        "items": [
          {
            "name": "Zurich Vista GIA",
            "is_managed": true,
            "john": 125000,
            "mary": 95000,
            "joint": 0,
            "total": 220000
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "type": "Bank Accounts",
        "items": [
          {
            "name": "Natwest Current Account",
            "is_managed": true,
            "john": 2250,
            "mary": 1750,
            "joint": 0,
            "total": 4000
          },
          {
            "name": "Barclays (unmanaged)",
            "is_managed": false,
            "john": 0,
            "mary": 0,
            "joint": 4500,
            "total": 4500
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "summary": {
      "managed_total": 425000,
      "unmanaged_total": 48000,
      "total_assets": 473000,
      "total_liabilities": 25000,

  }
}
```

#### Table Display Requirements

**Professional Styling Standards:**
- **Section Headers**: Bold uppercase text, dark gray borders, no background colors
- **Individual Items**: Clean indentation, light gray text, hover effects
- **Section Subtotals**: Light gray backgrounds, semibold italic text, clear borders  
- **Grand Totals**: Prominent borders, bold text, professional hierarchy
- **Monochromatic Design**: Gray color scheme suitable for financial documents
- **Typography**: Consistent font weights and right-aligned monetary values

**Hierarchical Structure:**
1. Item type header (e.g., "GIAS", "BANK ACCOUNTS")
2. Individual items with specific names and ownership breakdown
3. Section subtotal with calculated totals per item type
4. Grand total across all asset types with ownership distribution
