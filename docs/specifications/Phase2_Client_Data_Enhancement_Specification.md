# Phase 2: Client Data Enhancement Specification

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-08-26  
**Status:** Draft - For Visual Prototype Development

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 2 is a **supplementary enhancement** to Kingston's Portal that adds comprehensive client data management capabilities **alongside the existing managed product infrastructure**. This phase introduces flexible client information storage, unmanaged product tracking, and historical data snapshots for compliance and audit requirements.

### Core Business Driver
- **Problem:** Need historical snapshots of client data for compliance ("What did we know when we made this decision?")
- **Solution:** Dual-track system - managed products (existing) + unmanaged client data (new)
- **Benefit:** Complete client picture with point-in-time audit trails for KYC and networth statements

### System Enhancement Philosophy
- **Existing managed products:** Preserve all current IRR calculations, analytics, and performance tracking
- **NEW unmanaged products:** Simple valuation tracking for KYC/networth purposes only  
- **NEW client information:** JSON-based flexible data for comprehensive client profiles
- **Historical preservation:** Snapshot capability for compliance and decision audit trails

---

## 1. System Architecture Changes

### 1.1 Data Model Overhaul

#### Enhanced Client Groups
- **Mandatory Fields:** Name and type only
- **Optional Fields:** All other information can be added retrospectively
- **Retrospective Enhancement:** Easy data addition over time
- **Multi-product owner associations** with flexible ownership models

#### Product Owner Relationships
- **Mandatory Fields:** First name and surname only
- **Optional Fields:** DOB, Address, Marital Status, Vulnerability Status
- **Ordering:** By inception date (date/time product owner was created in system)
- **Ownership Model:** Product owners are associated with items, not direct owners
- **Field Constraints:** Text fields up to 200 characters, phone numbers as plain text
- **Data Sensitivity:** All information treated as sensitive personal/financial data

#### New Item-Based Architecture
```
Client Group ‚Üí Items (JSON data) ‚Üí Product Owner Associations (with ownership types)
```

### 1.2 New Database Entities

#### Client Information Items Table (Hybrid Approach)
```sql
client_information_items (
  id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
  client_group_id BIGINT FK,
  item_type ENUM('basic_detail', 'income_expenditure', 'assets_liabilities', 'protection', 'vulnerability_health'),
  item_category VARCHAR(100),    -- e.g., "Home Address", "Bank Account", "Property", "Insurance Policy"
  data_content JSONB,            -- Flexible JSON structure with embedded ownership for applicable items
  date_created TIMESTAMP,
  date_updated TIMESTAMP,
  last_edited_by BIGINT FK       -- References profiles table
)
```

#### JSON Structure Examples
```json
-- Home Address (Basic Detail - No ownership associations)
{
  "address_line_one": "1 New Street",
  "address_line_two": "Neverland", 
  "postcode": "N0TH 3R3"
}

-- Bank Account (Asset - With ownership associations)
{
  "bank": "Barclays",
  "latest_valuation": 2500,
  "associated_product_owners": {
    "association_type": "tenants_in_common",
    "123": 50,
    "456": 50
  }
}

-- Joint ISA (Asset - Joint ownership example)  
{
  "provider": "Vanguard",
  "account_type": "Stocks & Shares ISA",
  "latest_valuation": 15000,
  "associated_product_owners": {

POST   /api/items/{id}/validate-ownership               # Validate percentage splits
```

### 3.2 Frontend Component Requirements

#### New Components Needed
- `ProductOwnerCard` - Individual product owner display (reuse existing card patterns)
- `ClientItemEditor` - Create/edit client information items modal (styled like existing create modals)
- `UnmanagedProductEditor` - Create/edit unmanaged products modal (styled like existing create modals)
- `NetworthStatementTable` - Financial position table with sections and ownership columns
- `KYCReportBuilder` - Report generation interface with preview

#### Component Reuse Strategy
- **Main List Tab:** Use existing `DataTable` with `TableFilter` and `TableSort` components
- **Item Type Filtering:** Use existing `MultiSelectDropdown` for item type selection
- **Actions:** Leverage existing `ActionButton`, `AddButton`, `EditButton`, `DeleteButton` family
- **Forms:** Use existing input components (`BaseInput`, `NumberInput`, `BaseDropdown`)
- **Product Creation:** Extend existing "Create Products" page with new "Unmanaged Product" option
- **Modal Styling:** Follow existing modal patterns and styling for consistency

### 3.3 Implementation Strategy (ADD-ON Approach)

#### Phase 1: New Infrastructure Addition
- Add new `client_information_items` table alongside existing tables
- Add new `client_unmanaged_products` table for non-IRR products
- Add `inception_date` to existing `product_owners` table
- **ZERO CHANGES** to existing managed product infrastructure

#### Phase 2: Supplementary API Development
- **NEW endpoints only:** `/api/client_groups/{id}/items`, `/api/client_groups/{id}/unmanaged_products`
- **Existing endpoints unchanged:** All current managed product APIs remain identical
- **Enhanced client details:** New tabs added to existing client details page
- **Preserved functionality:** All current features continue working exactly as before

#### Phase 3: Feature Rollout
- Enable new client information management system
- Deploy enhanced client details interface with new tabs
- User training on additional capabilities (existing workflows unchanged)
- Monitor performance of new features without affecting existing operations

## 4. User Experience Design Principles

### 4.1 Minimal Setup Philosophy
- **Client Groups:** Name and type only initially required
- **Product Owners:** Name only initially required
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Easy data addition over time

### 4.2 Ownership Model
- **Tenants in Common:** Separate percentage ownership per product owner (individual % for each)
- **Joint Ownership:** Collective ownership percentage for all associated product owners (single % for group)
- **Scope:** Only applies to products, assets & liabilities, and protection items
- **Third Party Ownership:** No validation that percentages sum to 100% (allows for external ownership)
- **Flexible Associations:** Items can exist without any product owner associations

### 4.3 Data Management Philosophy
- **Dual-Track System:** Managed products (full IRR infrastructure) + unmanaged products (simple valuations)
- **Provider Integration:** Unmanaged products use existing `available_providers` table for consistency
- **Product Lifecycle:** Unmanaged products can transition to managed products over time
- **Embedded Ownership:** Product owner associations stored within JSON for assets/liabilities/protection
- **Flexible Schema:** JSON structure adapts to any data type without schema changes
- **Historical Preservation:** Networth statements create audit snapshots with complete data at creation time
- **Universal Access:** All advisors can view and edit all clients and items
- **Concurrent Editing Control:** Prevent multiple advisors editing same item simultaneously
- **Data Retention:** All data retained indefinitely unless explicitly deleted
- **No Change Logging:** No audit trail required for item modifications

### 4.4 Unmanaged to Managed Product Transition
- **Business Workflow:** Unmanaged products may be sold/transferred into new managed products
- **Status Tracking:** Unmanaged products can be marked as 'sold' when transferred
- **Value Transfer:** Money from unmanaged product becomes initial investment in new managed product
- **Historical Continuity:** Both original unmanaged and new managed product retained for audit purposes
- **Advisory Process:** Advisors can create managed product and reference the unmanaged product it replaces

### 4.4 Information Architecture
- **Client-Centric:** All information belongs to client group first
- **Association-Based:** Flexible product owner relationships with ownership types
- **Category-Driven:** Clear item type organization (Basic Detail, Income/Expenditure, etc.)
