POST   /api/items/{id}/validate-ownership               # Validate percentage splits
```

### 3.2 Frontend Component Requirements

#### New Components Needed
- `ProductOwnerCard` - Individual product owner display (reuse existing card patterns)
- `ClientItemEditor` - Create/edit client information items modal (styled like existing create modals)
- `UnmanagedProductEditor` - Create/edit unmanaged products modal (styled like existing create modals)
- `NetworthStatementTable` - Financial position table with sections and ownership columns
- `KYCReportBuilder` - Report generation interface with preview

#### Component Reuse Strategy
- **Main List Tab:** Use existing `DataTable` with `TableFilter` and `TableSort` components
- **Item Type Filtering:** Use existing `MultiSelectDropdown` for item type selection
- **Actions:** Leverage existing `ActionButton`, `AddButton`, `EditButton`, `DeleteButton` family
- **Forms:** Use existing input components (`BaseInput`, `NumberInput`, `BaseDropdown`)
- **Product Creation:** Extend existing "Create Products" page with new "Unmanaged Product" option
- **Modal Styling:** Follow existing modal patterns and styling for consistency

### 3.3 Implementation Strategy (ADD-ON Approach)

#### Phase 1: New Infrastructure Addition
- Add new `client_information_items` table alongside existing tables
- Add new `client_unmanaged_products` table for non-IRR products
- Add `inception_date` to existing `product_owners` table
- **ZERO CHANGES** to existing managed product infrastructure

#### Phase 2: Supplementary API Development
- **NEW endpoints only:** `/api/client_groups/{id}/items`, `/api/client_groups/{id}/unmanaged_products`
- **Existing endpoints unchanged:** All current managed product APIs remain identical
- **Enhanced client details:** New tabs added to existing client details page
- **Preserved functionality:** All current features continue working exactly as before

#### Phase 3: Feature Rollout
- Enable new client information management system
- Deploy enhanced client details interface with new tabs
- User training on additional capabilities (existing workflows unchanged)
- Monitor performance of new features without affecting existing operations

## 4. User Experience Design Principles

### 4.1 Minimal Setup Philosophy
- **Client Groups:** Name and type only initially required
- **Product Owners:** Name only initially required
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Easy data addition over time

### 4.2 Ownership Model
- **Tenants in Common:** Separate percentage ownership per product owner (individual % for each)
- **Joint Ownership:** Collective ownership percentage for all associated product owners (single % for group)
- **Scope:** Only applies to products, assets & liabilities, and protection items
- **Third Party Ownership:** No validation that percentages sum to 100% (allows for external ownership)
- **Flexible Associations:** Items can exist without any product owner associations

### 4.3 Data Management Philosophy
- **Dual-Track System:** Managed products (full IRR infrastructure) + unmanaged products (simple valuations)
- **Provider Integration:** Unmanaged products use existing `available_providers` table for consistency
- **Product Lifecycle:** Unmanaged products can transition to managed products over time
- **Embedded Ownership:** Product owner associations stored within JSON for assets/liabilities/protection
- **Flexible Schema:** JSON structure adapts to any data type without schema changes
- **Historical Preservation:** Networth statements create audit snapshots with complete data at creation time
- **Universal Access:** All advisors can view and edit all clients and items
- **Concurrent Editing Control:** Prevent multiple advisors editing same item simultaneously
- **Data Retention:** All data retained indefinitely unless explicitly deleted
- **No Change Logging:** No audit trail required for item modifications

### 4.4 Unmanaged to Managed Product Transition
- **Business Workflow:** Unmanaged products may be sold/transferred into new managed products
- **Status Tracking:** Unmanaged products can be marked as 'sold' when transferred
- **Value Transfer:** Money from unmanaged product becomes initial investment in new managed product
- **Historical Continuity:** Both original unmanaged and new managed product retained for audit purposes
- **Advisory Process:** Advisors can create managed product and reference the unmanaged product it replaces

### 4.4 Information Architecture
- **Client-Centric:** All information belongs to client group first
- **Association-Based:** Flexible product owner relationships with ownership types
- **Category-Driven:** Clear item type organization (Basic Detail, Income/Expenditure, etc.)
