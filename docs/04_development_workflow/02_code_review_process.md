# Code Review Process

## Overview

Kingston's Portal implements a **collaborative code review process** designed for a 2-developer team with AI-assisted development. The process emphasizes rapid feedback, knowledge sharing, and quality assurance while maintaining development velocity.

## Review Philosophy

### AI-Assisted Development Review

**Core Principle**: All AI-generated code requires human review to ensure quality, security, and architectural alignment.

**Review Focus Areas**:
1. **AI Code Quality**: Verify AI-generated code meets project standards
2. **Architectural Alignment**: Ensure AI suggestions follow established patterns  
3. **Security Validation**: Human oversight of security-sensitive code
4. **Performance Impact**: Review AI optimizations and their implications
5. **Maintainability**: Assess long-term code maintainability

## Review Requirements

### Mandatory Reviews

**All Changes Require Review**:
- Pull requests to `main` branch (protected)
- Database schema modifications
- Security-related changes
- API endpoint modifications
- Shared utility functions
- Deployment script changes

**Evidence from Repository**:
```bash
# Recent PRs show consistent review process
Merge pull request #169 from Animatic-AI-Solutions/previous_funds_double_counting
Merge pull request #168 from Animatic-AI-Solutions/total_portfolio_irr_fix
Merge pull request #167 from Animatic-AI-Solutions/avoid_owner_name_if_one
```

### Review Exemptions

**Direct Commits Allowed** (emergency situations only):
- Critical production hotfixes (with immediate follow-up PR)
- Documentation typo fixes
- Local configuration changes

### 2. Code Review (Reviewer)

#### Review Criteria

**Functional Review**:
```markdown
## Code Functionality
- [ ] Code accomplishes stated objectives
- [ ] Edge cases are handled appropriately
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Business logic is correct

## AI-Generated Code Assessment
- [ ] AI code aligns with project patterns
- [ ] Human oversight appears adequate
- [ ] No obvious AI-generated security issues
- [ ] Code quality meets human-written standards
```

**Technical Review**:
```markdown
## Code Quality
- [ ] Follows SPARC methodology principles
- [ ] Functions are appropriately sized (â‰¤50 lines)
- [ ] Files are manageable (â‰¤500 lines)
- [ ] Naming conventions followed
- [ ] Comments are meaningful (not excessive)

## Architecture & Patterns
- [ ] Uses existing components/utilities when appropriate
- [ ] Follows established architectural patterns
- [ ] Shared modules pattern respected
- [ ] API design consistency maintained
```

**Security Review**:
```markdown
## Security Considerations
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Authentication/authorization appropriate
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention measures
- [ ] HttpOnly cookie security maintained
```

#### Review Comments Standards

**Constructive Feedback Format**:
```markdown
## Issue Severity Levels

### ðŸ”´ Critical (Must Fix)
Issues that break functionality, introduce security vulnerabilities, or violate core architectural principles.

Example:
> ðŸ”´ **Security**: This function doesn't validate input, creating a potential SQL injection risk. Please use parameterized queries.

### ðŸŸ¡ Important (Should Fix)  
Issues that affect code quality, performance, or maintainability but don't break functionality.

Example:
> ðŸŸ¡ **Performance**: Consider using the cached version of this calculation from the analytics service to avoid repeated database queries.

### ðŸŸ¢ Suggestion (Nice to Have)
Improvements that enhance code quality but aren't mandatory for merge.

Example:  
> ðŸŸ¢ **Suggestion**: Consider extracting this formatting logic to the shared utils to maintain the DRY principle.

### ðŸ¤– AI Code Review
Specific feedback on AI-generated code quality and human validation.

Example:
> ðŸ¤– **AI Code**: This AI-generated function looks good, but consider adding error handling for the edge case where the portfolio has no funds.
```

### 3. Review Response (Author)

**Response Standards**:
```markdown
## Addressing Review Comments

### For Critical Issues (ðŸ”´)
- Address immediately before merge
- Add tests to prevent regression
- Reply with explanation of fix

### For Important Issues (ðŸŸ¡)  
- Address in current PR or create follow-up issue
- Provide rationale if not addressing immediately
- Discuss with reviewer if needed

### For Suggestions (ðŸŸ¢)
