# Coding Principles

This document outlines the core principles that guide our development process. Adhering to these principles ensures we build a high-quality, maintainable, and robust application.

## 1. Core Philosophy (SPARC)

Our development workflow is based on the SPARC methodology:

- **Specification:** Define clear objectives, requirements, and acceptance criteria before writing code.
- **Pseudocode:** Map out the logical implementation pathways to identify core functions and algorithms.
- **Architecture:** Design modular components with clear boundaries and a proper separation of concerns.
- **Refinement:** Implement with a focus on Test-Driven Development (TDD), security, and optimization.
- **Completion:** Integrate, document, test, and verify the final implementation against the initial specification.

## 2. Code Quality Rules

- **File & Function Size Limits:**
  - Every file should be **no more than 500 lines**.
  - Every function should be **no more than 50 lines** and have a clear, single responsibility.
  - *Note: As noted in our [Strengths and Limitations](./../1_introduction/02_project_strengths_and_limitations.md), some legacy components do not yet meet this standard and are slated for refactoring.*
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Eliminate code duplication by abstracting common logic into reusable functions, components, or services.
- **Clean Code:**
  - Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes, following our [Naming Conventions](./02_naming_conventions.md).
  - Maintain consistent formatting (enforced by linters).
  - Minimize nesting and cyclomatic complexity.

## 3. SOLID Principles

We strive to follow the SOLID principles in our object-oriented and component-based design:

- **(S) Single Responsibility Principle:** Every class, function, or component should have one, and only one, reason to change.
- **(O) Open/Closed Principle:** Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. We favor composition and dependency injection over inheritance.
- **(L) Liskov Substitution Principle:** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
- **(I) Interface Segregation Principle:** Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. We prefer smaller, more focused interfaces.
- **(D) Dependency Inversion Principle:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

## 4. Security Essentials

- **No Hard-coded Secrets:** Never commit credentials, API keys, or environment-specific variables. See our [Security Considerations](../6_advanced/01_security_considerations.md) for more.
- **Validate and Sanitize All Inputs:** Treat all data from external sources as untrusted.
- **Proper Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling in all code paths to prevent crashes and avoid leaking sensitive information.

## 5. Testability

- **Design for Testability:** Write code that is easy to test.
- **TDD (London School):** Follow a "Red-Green-Refactor" [Testing Strategy](./03_testing_strategy.md).
