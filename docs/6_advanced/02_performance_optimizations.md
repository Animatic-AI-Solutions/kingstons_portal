# Performance Optimizations

This document details the strategies and techniques used to ensure the Kingston's Portal application is fast, responsive, and scalable.

## 1. Backend & Database Optimizations

The backend and database are optimized to handle large datasets and complex queries efficiently.

### Optimized SQL Views
- **Primary Strategy:** To avoid slow, complex `JOIN` operations and aggregations in the API, we pre-compute and store this data in optimized SQL views, as detailed in the [Database Schema](../3_architecture/03_database_schema.md).
- **Key Views:**
  - `client_group_complete_data`: Aggregates all information for the main Clients dashboard.
  - `complete_fund_data`: Provides a comprehensive snapshot of each fund, including its latest valuation and IRR.
  - `provider_revenue_breakdown`: Pre-calculates revenue metrics for the analytics section.
- **Impact:** This is the most significant performance optimization, drastically reducing database load and speeding up response times for data-intensive pages.

### Indexing
- The `database.sql` schema includes over **50 strategically placed indexes** on foreign keys, date columns, status fields, and frequently searched text fields.
- This ensures that database lookups, filtering, and sorting operations are extremely fast.

### Bulk API Endpoints
- The API provides several endpoints designed to return all necessary data for a given page in a single request (e.g., `/api/bulk_client_data`).
- This pattern minimizes the number of HTTP round-trips required to render a page.

### Asynchronous Operations
- The use of **FastAPI (ASGI)** allows the backend to handle I/O-bound operations (like database calls) asynchronously, enabling it to efficiently manage many concurrent requests.

## 2. Frontend Optimizations

The frontend is designed to feel fast and responsive to the user.

### Server State Caching with React Query
- **Caching:** React Query automatically caches all data fetched from the API. Data is served instantly from the cache while a fresh copy is fetched in the background. For more details, see the [State Management guide](../5_frontend_guide/02_state_management.md).
- **`staleTime`:** Data is considered fresh for 5 minutes by default, preventing unnecessary refetching.

### Bundle Optimization
- The project is built using **Vite**, which provides highly optimized production builds with features like tree-shaking, minification, and modern browser targetting.
