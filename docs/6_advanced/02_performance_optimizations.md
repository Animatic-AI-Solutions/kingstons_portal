# Performance Optimizations

This document details the strategies and techniques used to ensure the Kingston's Portal application is fast, responsive, and scalable.

## 1. Backend & Database Optimizations

The backend and database are optimized to handle large datasets and complex queries efficiently.

### Optimized SQL Views
- **Primary Strategy:** To avoid slow, complex `JOIN` operations and aggregations in the API, we pre-compute and store this data in optimized SQL views, as detailed in the [Database Schema](../3_architecture/03_database_schema.md).
- **Key Views:**
  - `client_group_complete_data`: Aggregates all information for the main Clients dashboard.
  - `complete_fund_data`: Provides a comprehensive snapshot of each fund, including its latest valuation and IRR.
  - `provider_revenue_breakdown`: Pre-calculates revenue metrics for the analytics section.
- **Impact:** This is the most significant performance optimization, drastically reducing database load and speeding up response times for data-intensive pages.

### Ultra-Fast Analytics Performance System
A specialized performance optimization system has been implemented to address critical analytics loading issues:

#### Problem Resolution
- **Issue:** Analytics dashboard experiencing 67+ second load times due to intensive real-time IRR calculations
- **Root Cause:** Complex financial calculations running synchronously for every dashboard load
- **Solution:** Multi-layered optimization approach combining pre-computation, caching, and asynchronous processing

#### Analytics-Specific Views
- **`company_irr_cache`:** Stores pre-computed company-wide IRR values with 24-hour cache duration
- **`analytics_dashboard_summary`:** Aggregates key metrics (clients, accounts, total funds managed, FUM) for instant dashboard loading
- **`fund_distribution_fast`:** Pre-computed fund allocation data for analytics charts
- **`provider_distribution_fast`:** Pre-computed provider distribution analytics

#### Performance Improvements
- **Response Time:** Reduced from 67+ seconds to sub-second (<2 seconds target)
- **Cache Strategy:** 24-hour intelligent caching for company IRR calculations
- **Background Processing:** Asynchronous IRR refresh prevents UI blocking
- **Graceful Degradation:** Automatic fallback to real-time calculations if views unavailable

#### API Optimization
- **Ultra-Fast Endpoint:** `/analytics/dashboard-fast` leverages all pre-computed views
- **Background Refresh:** `/analytics/company/irr/refresh-background` for non-blocking updates
- **Intelligent Error Handling:** Service unavailable (503) responses with helpful deployment guidance
- **Logging Optimization:** Reduced verbose IRR calculation logging to minimize performance overhead

### Indexing
- The `database.sql` schema includes over **50 strategically placed indexes** on foreign keys, date columns, status fields, and frequently searched text fields.
- This ensures that database lookups, filtering, and sorting operations are extremely fast.

### Bulk API Endpoints
- The API provides several endpoints designed to return all necessary data for a given page in a single request (e.g., `/api/bulk_client_data`).
- This pattern minimizes the number of HTTP round-trips required to render a page.

### Asynchronous Operations
- The use of **FastAPI (ASGI)** allows the backend to handle I/O-bound operations (like database calls) asynchronously, enabling it to efficiently manage many concurrent requests.

## 2. Frontend Optimizations

The frontend is designed to feel fast and responsive to the user.

### Server State Caching with React Query
- **Caching:** React Query automatically caches all data fetched from the API. Data is served instantly from the cache while a fresh copy is fetched in the background. For more details, see the [State Management guide](../5_frontend_guide/02_state_management.md).
- **`staleTime`:** Data is considered fresh for 5 minutes by default, preventing unnecessary refetching.

### Bundle Optimization
- The project is built using **Vite**, which provides highly optimized production builds with features like tree-shaking, minification, and modern browser targetting.
