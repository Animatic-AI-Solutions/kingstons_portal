# Project Goals

## 1. Primary Objective

To provide wealth management advisors and administrators with a clear, efficient, and robust platform to manage client information, accounts, and investments. The system must track investment performance accurately, preserve historical records, and offer insightful company-wide analytics to support informed decision-making.

## 2. Core Functional Goals

- **Client Management:** Offer comprehensive tools for managing client groups, individual product owners, and their relationships.
- **Account & Product Management:** Track all client financial products, their associated portfolios, providers, and performance.
- **Investment Tracking:** Provide detailed views of investment holdings, including valuations, cost basis, and performance metrics (IRR).
- **Activity Logging:** Maintain a complete and immutable audit trail of all financial activities, including investments, withdrawals, and switches.
- **Performance Analytics:** Deliver powerful analytics at the client, product, portfolio, and company level.
- **Reporting:** Generate clear and insightful reports for internal review and client meetings.

## 3. User Experience (UX) Goals

- **Clarity & Readability:** Prioritize a user interface with large fonts, high contrast, and logical layouts, specifically designed for experienced users who may be aged 50+. For more details, see the [Frontend Design Philosophy](../5_frontend_guide/01_design_philosophy.md).
- **Simplicity:** Ensure intuitive navigation and workflows to minimize cognitive load and reduce the learning curve.
- **Efficiency:** Design workflows that map directly to an advisor's real-world tasks, enabling them to complete their work with minimal friction.

## 4. Technical Goals

- **Modularity & Maintainability:** Build the system with a clean, modular architecture (SOLID, DRY) to ensure it is easy to understand, maintain, and extend. See our [Coding Principles](../4_development_standards/01_coding_principles.md).
- **Security:** Implement enterprise-grade security practices, including secure authentication, data validation, and protection against common vulnerabilities. See [Security Considerations](../6_advanced/01_security_considerations.md).
- **Performance:** Optimize the application for fast load times and responsive interactions, especially when handling large datasets. See [Performance Optimizations](../6_advanced/02_performance_optimizations.md).
- **Scalability:** Design the architecture to be scalable to accommodate future growth in users, clients, and data volume.
- **Testability:** Ensure all code is written to be easily testable, with high unit and integration test coverage, as outlined in our [Testing Strategy](../4_development_standards/03_testing_strategy.md).

## 5. Team Development & Collaboration Goals

- **AI-Assisted Development:** Leverage AI coding assistants and Cursor IDE to enhance development productivity and code quality across a 2-developer team.
- **Distributed Development:** Support efficient collaboration across separate development environments with robust Git workflows for regular commits and merges.
- **Code Consistency:** Maintain consistent coding standards and practices across team members through shared tooling and documentation.

## 6. Data Security & Compliance Goals

Given the highly sensitive nature of client financial and personal information:

- **Data Sovereignty:** âœ… Completed transition to in-house PostgreSQL server to maintain complete control over sensitive client data.
- **Enhanced Security:** Implement enterprise-grade security measures appropriate for handling confidential financial information.
- **Compliance Readiness:** Ensure the system architecture supports regulatory compliance requirements for financial data handling.
- **Access Control:** Implement strict role-based access controls and audit trails for all data access and modifications.
- **Data Isolation:** Maintain client data within the organization's secure network infrastructure rather than third-party cloud services.
