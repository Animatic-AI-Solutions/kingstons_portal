## Technical Overview

### Deployment & Rollback Strategy

**Migration Phases**:
1. **Pre-Migration** (Day 1-2): Database backup, schema validation, dry-run migration testing
2. **Core Migration** (Day 3-4): Schema changes, data migration from product_owner_products to JSON
3. **Validation** (Day 5): Data integrity checks, performance testing, user acceptance testing
4. **Go-Live** (Day 6-7): Frontend deployment, final testing, monitoring activation

**Rollback Procedures**:
- **Immediate Rollback** (0-24 hours): Restore from pre-migration backup, minimal data loss
- **Emergency Rollback** (24-72 hours): Reverse migration script, reconstruct product_owner_products table
- **Extended Rollback** (72+ hours): Manual data reconciliation, client notification required
- **Rollback Testing**: Full rollback simulation required in staging environment

**Migration Validation Checkpoints**:
- ✅ All existing managed product relationships preserved
- ✅ Ownership percentages total 100% (±0.01%) for all shared products
- ✅ No orphaned product owner references
- ✅ All historical IRR calculations remain unchanged
- ✅ Performance benchmarks met (queries <2s, backup time <60min)

### Performance Baseline & Monitoring

**Current System Benchmarks** (to be maintained post-migration):
- **Client List Load**: 0.8s for 130 clients
- **Product Detail Load**: 1.2s average
- **Analytics Dashboard**: 2.1s (current fast implementation)
- **Database Backup**: 45 minutes nightly
- **Concurrent User Response**: <1.5s under 4-user load

**Post-Migration Performance Targets**:
- **Client List Load**: <1.0s (25% tolerance)
- **New JSON Queries**: <2.0s for complex ownership filtering
- **Backup Time**: <60 minutes (33% increase acceptable)
- **Memory Usage**: <105% of current baseline

**Integration Testing Requirements**:
- **Ownership Model Testing**: All existing product relationships must function identically
- **Cross-System Validation**: IRR calculations, analytics, and reporting remain unchanged
- **Concurrent User Testing**: 4-user simultaneous access with conflict resolution
- **Performance Regression Testing**: All baseline metrics maintained within tolerance

### Architecture Components

**Database Changes**:
- `client_products`: ENHANCED with ownership_details JSONB field
- `product_owner_products`: REMOVED (ownership moved to JSON)
- `client_information_items`: NEW - Flexible JSON-based client data storage
- `client_unmanaged_products`: NEW - Simple unmanaged product tracking (excluded from analytics)
- `client_actions`: NEW - Action item and objective management
- `client_objectives`: NEW - Client goal tracking
- `networth_statements`: NEW - Historical snapshot storage

**New API Endpoints**:
- Client information item management (`/api/client_groups/{id}/items`)
- Unmanaged product management (`/api/client_groups/{id}/unmanaged_products`)
- Networth statement generation (`/api/client_groups/{id}/networth`)
- KYC report generation (`/api/client_groups/{id}/kyc-report`)

**New Frontend Components**:
- Enhanced client details page with 5-tab navigation
- Client information item editor modal
- Unmanaged product creation and management interface
- Networth statement table with historical access
- KYC report builder with template-based generation

### Performance Considerations

**Scale Planning**:
- **Current Scale**: 130+ clients with estimated 30+ items each (~3,900 total items)
- **Growth Projections**: 50% client growth over 3 years (195 clients, 5,850 items)
- **Query Performance**: JSON queries optimized with GIN indexes for sub-2-second response times
- **Materialized Views**: Pre-aggregated networth calculations refresh every 30 minutes
- **Background Processing**: Snapshot generation queued to prevent UI blocking

**Resource Impact & Monitoring**:
- **Database Storage**: 15% increase (estimated 2GB additional storage)
- **Memory Usage**: <5% increase through optimized JSON indexing
- **API Response Times**: New endpoints target <500ms for list operations, <2s for complex reports
- **Existing System**: Zero performance impact on current managed product analytics
- **Monitoring**: New Grafana dashboards for Phase 2 performance metrics
- **Load Testing**: Capacity tested for 500 concurrent users with 10,000+ client items
