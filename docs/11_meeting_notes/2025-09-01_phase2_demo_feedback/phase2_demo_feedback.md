# Phase 2 Demo Client Feedback

**Date:** September 1, 2025  
**Demo:** Phase 2 Client Data Enhancement mockups  
**Attendees:** Client stakeholders, development team  

## Overview

Client demo of Phase 2 mockups revealed significant UI/UX preferences and requirements that necessitated major architectural changes to the original design.

## Key Feedback Areas

### 1. Product Owner Cards - Layout & Information Density

**Client Feedback:**
- Current 3-column card layout too cramped and hard to read
- Need more comprehensive contact information
- Want professional, information-dense display

**Requirements:**
- **3-section layout:** Personal details (left) + Contact information (right) + Full-width meeting/compliance section (bottom)
- **Multiple phone numbers:** Mobile, House Phone, Work with clear labeling
- **Enhanced fields:** Email, phones, DOB, known as, title, NI number, security words, notes, meetings, compliance dates
- **Larger cards** with better spacing and readability
- **Terminology correction:** "Last T&Cs" → "Date Signed T&C"

### 2. Main List - Information Density Priority

**Client Feedback:**
- Card-based display too "fluffy" and wastes screen space
- Need maximum information density for efficient data review
- Want tabular format for quick scanning

**Requirements:**
- **Complete conversion** from cards to information-dense table
- **Slim rows** with columnar data display
- **Enhanced fields:** Type, Category, Summary, Priority, Status, Updated, By, Actions
- **Color-coded indicators** for priority and status
- **Summary statistics** footer

### 3. Objectives/Actions - Complete Architectural Separation

**Client Feedback:**
- Linking objectives and actions creates confusion
- Need objectives and actions as completely separate entities
- Want global actions view across all client groups

**Requirements:**
- **Complete separation:** Remove all objective_id relationships
- **Two-column layout:** Objectives left, Actions right
- **Global actions:** Actions accessible across all clients, not tied to specific objectives
- **PDF export capability** for actions
- **Columnar displays** for both objectives and actions with information density priority

### 4. Networth Statement - Liquidity-Based Asset Ordering

**Client Feedback:**
- Current asset ordering doesn't reflect liquidity importance
- Need proper financial hierarchy for professional wealth management
- Want enhanced asset categories and liability tracking

**Requirements:**
- **Hybrid ordering system:** Default asset type grouping with optional liquidity-based view toggle
- **Asset type default:** Bank Accounts, Pensions, Investments, Property groupings
- **Liquidity view option:** Most liquid assets first → Least liquid last (Bank Accounts → Cash ISAs → Stocks & Shares ISAs → GIAs → Property → Pensions)
- **Enhanced liabilities section:** Mortgages, credit cards, loans
- **Complete net worth calculation:** Assets - Liabilities = Net Worth
- **Individual ownership breakdown** maintained
- **User customizable:** Toggle between "Asset Type View" and "Liquidity View" per user preference

## Impact Assessment

### High Priority Changes
1. **UI Philosophy Shift:** From "aesthetic cards" to "information-dense tables"
2. **Architectural Change:** Complete objective-action separation
3. **Data Modeling:** Enhanced product owner fields, liquidity rankings
4. **User Experience:** Professional wealth management interface priority

### Implementation Requirements
1. **Database Schema Updates:** New fields for product owners, liquidity rankings
2. **API Endpoint Changes:** Separate objectives and actions endpoints
3. **Frontend Architecture:** Table-based components instead of card layouts
4. **Migration Strategy:** Safe deployment with rollback capabilities

## Action Items

- [x] Update Phase 2 documentation to reflect all client feedback
- [x] Resolve architectural conflicts in documentation
- [x] Define migration strategies for safe deployment
- [ ] Begin frontend implementation of new requirements
- [ ] Update database schema design
- [ ] Implement API endpoint changes

## Notes

- Client emphasized **information density over aesthetics** throughout the demo
- Strong preference for **professional wealth management interface** styling
- **Complete separation** of objectives and actions was stressed multiple times
- **Liquidity-based asset ordering** aligns with industry financial planning standards

## Next Steps

1. Complete documentation updates (✅ Done)
2. Begin frontend implementation with new requirements
3. Database schema updates for enhanced fields
4. API development for separated architecture
5. Testing and deployment with migration strategy
