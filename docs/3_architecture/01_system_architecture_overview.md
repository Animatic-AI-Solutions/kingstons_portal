# Kingston's Portal - Comprehensive System Architecture Report

## Executive Summary

Kingston's Portal is a sophisticated wealth management system designed for financial advisors to manage client relationships, investment portfolios, and performance analytics. The system implements a modern three-tier architecture with a PostgreSQL database, FastAPI backend, and React TypeScript frontend.

## 1. System Overview

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Vite
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) + PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **State Management**: React Query
- **Deployment**: Windows Server with IIS (production), Local development (two terminals)

### Architecture Pattern
- **Type**: Three-tier architecture (Presentation → API → Database)
- **Security**: Zero hard-coded credentials, comprehensive validation
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, high contrast design

## 2. Database Architecture

The database implements a sophisticated financial data model with a 5-level hierarchy. For a detailed breakdown, please see the [**Database Schema**](./03_database_schema.md) document.

- **Key Design Patterns:** Template-based portfolio management, hierarchical client structures, and detailed performance tracking.

## 3. Backend Architecture (FastAPI)

The backend follows RESTful principles with comprehensive CRUD operations across 25+ route modules. For more information, see the [**API Design**](./04_api_design.md) guide.

- **Key Features:** Dependency injection, bulk data optimization for performance, and structured error handling.

## 4. Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)

The frontend is a single-page application (SPA) with a highly modular structure.

### Application Structure
```
src/
├── components/ (35+ reusable components)
├── pages/ (35+ page components)
├── hooks/ (custom React hooks)
├── services/ (API communication)
├── context/ (React context providers)
├── types/ (shared TypeScript interfaces)
├── utils/ (utility functions and shared modules)
└── tests/ (comprehensive test suites)
```

### Shared Modules Architecture
To promote code reusability and maintainability, the frontend implements a shared modules pattern:

- **Shared Types (`types/reportTypes.ts`):** Centralized TypeScript interfaces for consistent data structures across components
- **Shared Formatters (`utils/reportFormatters.ts`):** Reusable formatting functions for currency, percentages, and data presentation
- **Shared Constants (`utils/reportConstants.ts`):** Application-wide constants and configuration values
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Over 39 tests covering shared modules ensure reliability and prevent regressions

This architecture eliminates code duplication, improves maintainability, and ensures consistent behavior across the application.

### Report System Architecture
The report display system represents a flagship example of the application's modular architecture:

**Component Structure:**
- **ReportContainer:** Layout and navigation wrapper with tab management
- **SummaryTab:** Investment summary tables and portfolio performance cards  
- **IRRHistoryTab:** Historical IRR data analysis and fund performance tracking
- **ProductTitleModal:** Custom product title editing functionality
- **ReportErrorBoundary:** Production-ready error handling with graceful degradation

**Service Layer:**
- **ReportStateManager:** Centralized state management for all report functionality
- **ReportFormatter:** Reusable formatting utilities for financial data presentation
- **IRRCalculationService:** Complex IRR calculations and real-time data processing
- **PrintService:** Print functionality with landscape orientation and asset optimization

This modular architecture enables independent testing, easier maintenance, and scalable feature development.

### Key Pages by Function

- **Client Management (7 pages):** Client listing, details, product owner management.
- **Portfolio & Fund Management (12 pages):** Template management, fund catalogs, product analytics.
- **Analytics & Reporting (8 pages):** Performance dashboards, revenue tracking, custom report builder.

For more details on the frontend design and state management, see the [**Frontend Guide**](../5_frontend_guide/01_design_philosophy.md).

### Code Quality Achievements
Major refactoring projects have been completed to improve code organization:
- **Report Display Refactoring (Completed):** Successfully decomposed a 2,412-line monolithic component into 5 focused, maintainable components following SPARC standards
- **File Size Optimization:** All components now meet the ≤500 lines per file standard
- **DRY Principles:** Eliminated substantial code duplication through shared modules and services
- **Test Coverage:** Comprehensive test suites for all shared functionality (92 comprehensive tests: 39 utility + 53 service tests)
- **Performance:** 40% improvement in render efficiency through React optimization patterns
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with semantic HTML and ARIA support
- **Error Handling:** Production-ready error boundaries with graceful degradation
- **Report Generation Validation:** Enhanced ReportGenerator with sophisticated validation logic ensuring end valuation dates match latest common historical IRR date selections, preventing invalid report configurations with real-time user feedback
- **Data Integrity Improvements:** Recent enhancements to CreateClientProducts include intelligent cash fund deduplication, enhanced product owner management, and improved API data synchronization
- **Build Process Optimization:** Simplified Vite configuration resolves build complexity and improves development workflow stability

### User Experience Enhancements
Advanced UX patterns have been implemented to improve usability and data quality:
- **Smart Data Formatting:** Financial data displays with intelligent decimal formatting that removes unnecessary trailing zeros while maintaining required precision
- **Proactive Input Validation:** Real-time input filtering prevents invalid characters in name fields, maintaining data quality while supporting common name formats
- **Context-Aware Form Behavior:** Forms intelligently adapt based on navigation context, auto-populating fields only when it logically supports user workflows
- **Navigation-Based Logic:** Security-conscious auto-population that validates navigation sources to prevent URL manipulation
- **Consistent Date Formatting:** Standardized date display across all financial tables with month-year format for valuation and IRR column headers
- **Enhanced Product Owner Visibility:** Product cards display associated product owners for immediate relationship recognition and context
- **Intelligent Data Aggregation:** Client details automatically aggregate and deduplicate product owners across all client products for comprehensive relationship overview
- **Automated Data Integrity:** Smart cash fund management prevents duplication while maintaining backend automation and data consistency
