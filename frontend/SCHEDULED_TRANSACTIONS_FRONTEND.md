**Service Layer:**
```typescript
// Create transaction
createScheduledTransaction(data: ScheduledTransactionCreate)

// Get transactions with filtering
getScheduledTransactions(params?: FilterParams)

// Status management
pauseScheduledTransaction(id: number)
resumeScheduledTransaction(id: number)
cancelScheduledTransaction(id: number)

// Edit operations
updateScheduledTransaction(id: number, data: ScheduledTransactionUpdate)
```

### 2. Portfolio Integration ✅

- Proper routing with protected routes
- Active state management

## UI/UX Design Patterns

### 1. Form Design ✅
- **Visual Transaction Type Selection:** Large clickable cards for Investment vs. Withdrawal
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Recurring options only appear when needed
- **Inline Validation:** Real-time feedback on field errors
- **Clear Labeling:** All fields have descriptive labels and help text

### 2. List Display ✅
- **Card-based Layout:** Each transaction in a clean card with clear visual hierarchy
- **Status Badges:** Color-coded status indicators
- **Action Buttons:** Properly grouped and labeled action buttons

- **Grid Layouts:** Responsive grids that adapt to screen size

## Data Flow

### 1. Creation Flow ✅
1. User selects transaction type (Investment/Withdrawal)
2. Form validates portfolio fund selection
3. User inputs amount and execution day
4. Optional recurring settings configuration
5. Form validation and submission
6. Success feedback and navigation to management view

### 2. Management Flow ✅
1. Load all transactions with filtering options
2. Display in card format with status and details
3. Provide action buttons based on current status
4. Handle status changes with confirmation dialogs
5. Real-time updates after mutations

### 3. Edit Flow ✅
1. Open edit modal with pre-populated form
2. Show read-only transaction info
3. Allow editing of modifiable fields
4. Validate changes and submit
5. Close modal and refresh list

## Testing Considerations

### 1. Form Validation Testing
