use the planner-agent to create an implementation plan for thsi page using TDD. Include red, green, and blue phases where the tester agent is used for the red phase, the coding agent is used for green phase, and the coder agent is used for the blue phase. Have explicit calls to these agents for each phase. Split the plan into multiple files.

a table of legal documents using the phase 2 table

the table has columns: type, people (product owners), date, status, actions (using the lapse/reactive/delete icons where the delete an dreactivate icons only appear iof it is lapsed)

when you clik on a row it opens the documenet details modal allowing the iuser to edit its fields (type, status, people, date, notes) where people uses the mmultiselect dropdown component for product owners and date uses the date input component

lapsed docuemnets go to the bottom of the table and are greyed out

have a create button like in special relationships which uses the combo component for type (will, LPOA P&F, LOPA H&W, EPA, General Power of Attorney, Advanc Directive)

Use reusable componenst from the UI folder where appropriate
