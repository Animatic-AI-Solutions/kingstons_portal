## Risk Assessment

### Low Risks (Documentation Only)
1. **Documentation Inconsistency**
   - **Mitigation**: Systematic cross-reference validation in Phase 5
   - **Impact**: Low - can be corrected during review

2. **Incomplete Technical Specification**
   - **Mitigation**: Use existing Phase 2 documentation patterns as templates
   - **Impact**: Low - missing details can be added before implementation

3. **User Workflow Gaps**
   - **Mitigation**: Reference existing Phase 2 user workflows for patterns
   - **Impact**: Low - workflow refinement can happen during actual implementation
