the main navigation does not include defintions as this was split inot what we see now which is templates and product owners and funds

clienst actually dont have a know as or a first or second nam ejust a name, the known as and other names are in regatrds to product owners

make sure to clarify what a client group (client as a whole) represents and what product owners (individuals inside the client group) represent

clarify that all funds in a portfolio need to have a vllautaion befroe an IRR is caluclated

when you generate a report yo dont select the start and end date, instead you select dates to include for each product and theybmuist all share the most recent date younsleect for each of them

there si only one report available which is the IRR report
