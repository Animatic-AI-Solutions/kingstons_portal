 now i got reefback from the client that instead fo having 2 fee types (fixed and percentage) theree shoudl now be 3 types (fixed fee      
direct, fixed fee facilitated, percentage fee facilitated), so we will have to mmodify the the create clienbt products page, the product    
 overview page, the lcient gropup detaisl page, the revenue page and possibly the databse structure as well\

First make a plan to refactor fixed fee to fixed fee faciliated (only fixed fee and not percentage fee) this includes changing names of some views and tables
