remember there should alos be a total column for each row in the net worth statement

in the main item list yeh columns should be: category (with emoji and category lable e.g Assets and Liabilities OR Basic Information), type (e.g Bank Account, Product, Address), owner (the product owner associated wit the item, remember that this doesn't indicate actualy ownership as the client group owns all the items but most item swill also be associated with a product owner to show which individual the item refers to), last edited, view/edit

remember that actions need a compelted and an in-progress section to separate done actions, show the action title as well as the details for the use to view, if the descriotion is too long then allow the user to expand it

remember that the all clients page is not part of the 5 tabs inside the cliebt details page, this is a separate page navigable via in the site side bar
