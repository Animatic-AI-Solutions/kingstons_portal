for now only include start date for assets and liabilities and for all other items only use last modified

for now only us ethe hybrid modern card approach with th assets and liabilities tabel so i can make a comparison between the 2 wasy of dispalying our data, I want to get feedbakc on this befroe implementing it in all fo the big category pages

income/ependicture is not an item type they are a big 5 category

I am not sure where yuo have seen policy type

do not standardise current value and amount and sum assured as these mean slightly different things

mananging the refactir of the current product management in the ssytem to accomodate the new data will be a challenging and complex tasks we still need to plan
