ok quite frankly this codebase is an absolyte mess, naming  conventions are inconsistent, we have ambigious functiona dn end point names which causes confusion, pretty sure almost none of out tests work and we NEED test to make sure our systekm is working correctly, i think out docs are out of date

we need to start refactoring before I move onto phase 2 of this project becssue we will be building on sand, the first thing I want to do is clean up the code itself, have consistent and non-ambiguous naming, follow better file size principles and better coding principles i general

lets discuss how we can tackle this, perhaps we can focus on one issue at a time codebasewide
