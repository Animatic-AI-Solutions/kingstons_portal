To effectively work on Kingston's Portal, please complete this familiarization sequence:

## Step 1: Core Understanding & Phase 2 Enhancements
Read `CLAUDE.md` to understand:
- Development commands and environment setup
- Phase 2 Client Data Enhancement with Big 5 categories (basic, contact, preferences, relationships, notes)
- Information-dense interfaces with enhanced phone management and professional workflows
- Key components, services, and utilities for enhanced client data functionality
- SPARC methodology and code quality standards with security-first approach
- Project-specific patterns including field-level encryption and audit logging

Then review `docs/README.md` for complete documentation navigation across 10 logical sections covering the comprehensive 7-phase refactor.

## Step 2: Enhanced Architecture Deep Dive
Read these documentation files in the enhanced order:
1. `docs/01_introduction/01_project_overview.md` - Enhanced project goals and Phase 2 capabilities
2. `docs/03_architecture/01_system_architecture_overview.md` - Complete enhanced system overview
3. `docs/03_architecture/02_api_architecture.md` - Enhanced API with 8 optimized client data endpoints
4. `docs/03_architecture/03_database_schema.md` - Enhanced database with Big 5 structure and audit logging
5. `docs/03_architecture/05_frontend_architecture.md` - Information-dense frontend with virtual scrolling
6. `docs/07_security/01_security_overview.md` - Multi-layer security framework with field-level encryption
7. `docs/06_performance/01_performance_monitoring.md` - Performance optimization and business intelligence
8. `docs/08_operations/01_deployment_procedures.md` - Comprehensive operations framework
9. `docs/05_development_standards/01_coding_principles.md` - SPARC methodology with security integration
10. `docs/04_development_workflow/01_git_workflow.md` - Enhanced Git practices and version control

## Step 3: Enhanced Component Library & Information-Dense Interfaces
Review the enhanced component library:
- Read `frontend/src/components/ui/COMPONENT_GUIDE.md` for core component patterns
- Browse `frontend/src/components/ui/index.ts` to see enhanced components including:
  - Information-dense interface components (3-section cards, dense tables)
  - Security-aware input components with field-level encryption
  - Performance-optimized components with virtual scrolling
  - Global actions workflow components for cross-client operations
- Understand the enhanced component architecture supporting Big 5 client data categories
- Review accessibility and responsive design patterns for professional workflows

## Step 4: Enhanced Service Patterns & Client Data Management
Examine these enhanced service patterns:
- `frontend/src/services/report/` - Enhanced report generation with business intelligence
- `frontend/src/hooks/` - Enhanced React hooks for information-dense data management
- `backend/app/services/` - Enhanced backend services with field-level encryption
- Client data service patterns for Big 5 categories with optimized performance
- Security service patterns for audit logging and field-level encryption
- Performance monitoring service patterns with real-time analytics
- Global actions service patterns for cross-client workflow management

## Step 5: Comprehensive Testing & Security Standards
Review enhanced testing and security patterns:
- `docs/04_development_workflow/03_testing_strategy.md` - Enhanced testing with security validation
- `frontend/src/tests/services/report/` - Enhanced service testing with performance benchmarks
- `frontend/src/tests/` - Utility and formatter tests with security test patterns
- Security testing patterns for field-level encryption and audit logging
- Performance testing for information-dense interfaces and virtual scrolling
- Load testing frameworks for enhanced client data operations
- `docs/05_development_standards/03_frontend_development_consistency.md` - Enhanced frontend standards

## Step 6: Enhanced Architecture & Operations Awareness
Familiarize with the complete enhanced architecture:
- **Security Framework**: Field-level encryption, comprehensive audit logging, multi-layer security
- **Performance Optimization**: Virtual scrolling, caching strategies, real-time monitoring
- **Information-Dense Interfaces**: Big 5 client data structure, professional workflow patterns
- **Operations Framework**: Automated deployment, incident response, maintenance procedures
- **Business Intelligence**: Enhanced analytics, performance dashboards, monitoring integration
- **Global Actions**: Cross-client workflows, bulk operations, professional advisor tools

Review these key operational documents:
- `docs/08_operations/02_maintenance_procedures.md` - Automated maintenance and monitoring
- `docs/06_performance/02_optimization_strategies.md` - Performance tuning for dense interfaces
- `docs/07_security/02_data_protection.md` - Field-level encryption and audit procedures
