I wnat to you create a prototype meetings page taht uses mock data

Meetings Page:

- comprivsed of the meeting schedule table and the total meetings table
- meeting schedule table shows all the meetings by client group troghout the year, has columns: client group, advisor, number of vulnerable people, ongoing start date, ongoing end date, number of meetings, each month where the cells are the meetings
- meetings are colour coded yellow for complete, blue for booked, orange for rescheduled, pruple for not booked
- rescheduled meetinsg shoudl be in the month of their new scehduled date but there shoudl be an ornage outline in the cell which was their expected month
- do not inlcude transactional clients for the metting schedule table
- when the vuilenerable people cell is clikce dit takes you to the vulnerability tgab for that client
- when clicking on the meeting it opens up a modal to manage that meeting where you can can see all of it’s im=nformatino and edit it
- you shoud be abel to change the year on the tyable and the information for meetings of previosu years is preserved
- in the meeting cell should be AR - advisor initials or just advisor initials if it is anything but an annual review type
- include a key to explain the colour coding
- the sppread of months is August to July
- There is a navigator to change the year

make the page compact
