client overview product owner cards:
- include home address
- should be 'date of signed T&C'
- meeting: meeting type and date (not time), next nearest meeting
- all phone numbers not just a single one
- include middle name
- *ordering of data in the product owner cards* - clarify with Dawn, one column with Mr -> first name -> middle names -> surname, DOB -> NI, one column with contact information, 2 columns side by side splitting the card in 2, all other information goes at the bottom of the card

Main List:
- we want to see as many items at once as possible (slim rows) and have item information in columns not underneath each other, columns = item category, item type, product owners associated 

Aims/objectives/actions:
- have items in columns, this is for visibility of everything, see as much on the pages possible
- an actions page in the site  sidebar with actions across all client groups ordered by due date
- separate objectives and actions, we do not want actions to be associated with objectives
- include date completed for actions
- be able to print a pdf of actions where the user can select which actions to include

Net worth:
- order: same as reports page for types that exist in the reports page, cash ISAs should go before stocks and shares, prioritize accessible (liquid) assets over non-liquid ones -> the further down the table we go the less liquid the assets get, at the bottom of the table are all the liabilities

General feedback: It's difficult to view things (easy of data visibility, limit padding as we want to see more on a page)
